# Assumptions

1. All letters correspond to English Alphabet;
1. 'Y' is always consonant at the beginning of the word;
1. '\s' and '-' are only possible delimiters
1. 'Punctuation-like' characters are all characters except English Alphabet + '\s' + '-' (non-latin, special chars like ',', '.', etc.);

Some settings could be done in `src/PigTransformer/config.ts`
